# mobileCompare
Project started for my Masters in IOT whit consisted in comparing mobile development methods performance, witch will hopefully lead in a continuous project to help developers and product owners chose an appropriate technology whit precise comparison metrics.
The majority of the code was exploratory, in case you notice something wrong feel free to contribute ;)
Thank you
